# Hi, I’m Evan!
- I graduated from the University of Michigan in April 2022. 
- I majored in ✨**Physics**✨, and had minors in **Chemistry**, and **Mathematics**.
- I'm currently working in the UM ATLAS group doing Quality Assurance for chamber production. 
- I'm familiar with **Python, LabVIEW,** and **LaTeX**. I'm slowly learning **ROOT** for work in high energy physics. :)
- My favorite shape is a trapezoid.
